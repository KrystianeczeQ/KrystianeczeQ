Tracking copyright
------------------
**Copyright statements**

Copyright statements must be included in:

- ``LICENSE`` file in the root of the repository.
- Headers of all source code files.

**Copyright holders**

Each copyright holder **must** be a legal entity.

Copyright is tracked for non-trivial contributions (i.e. creative work). By
default we consider anything above 15 lines for a non-trivial contribution.
Examples for which we do not track copyright is e.g. fixing a typo or tiny
bug fixes.


```
Legal entity: A legal entity can be human (physical persons) or
non-human (juridical persons, e.g. corporations). A legal entity has
privileges and obligations such as being able to enter into contracts, to
sue or be sued. Thus, e.g. CERN is a legal entity but e.g. ATLAS, CMS and
CS3 Organization are not considered legal entities by the law.
```

**Maintainer responsibility**

Maintainers are responsible for asking each contributor who is the copyright
holder of a given contribution (often, it's the employer who holds the
copyright).
